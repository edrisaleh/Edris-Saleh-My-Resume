        <p class="lead mb-4">As a third-year biomedical engineering student, I possess a unique blend of technical and interpersonal skills that make me a valuable asset to any team. My aptitude for problem-solving, combined with my outgoing and social nature, enables me to collaborate effectively with colleagues and engage with clients and stakeholders alike. With a passion for developing innovative solutions that improve healthcare outcomes, I bring a fresh perspective to the field of biomedical engineering. Whether I am designing medical devices or conducting research, I approach each project with a meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to delivering results that have a real-world impact. My drive to learn and grow as a professional is evident in my contributions to various open-source projects and my engagement with the bioengineering clubs at UCR. With my skills and enthusiasm, I am poised to make a significant contribution to the biomedical engineering field in the years to come. <br><br>

         Hardworking 20 year old college student . Strong organizational abilities with proven successes managing multiple academic projects and volunteering events. Has strong verbal and written communication skills. Currently experienced with arduino and COMSOL Multiphysics. Is currently developing skills in C++. Trilingual, hardworking, and ready to join my next team. Currently attending UC Riverside and am about to enter my third year as a junior. I am a biomedical engineering major and a computer science minor. I currently have experience with arduino and COMSOL Multiphysics. Furthermore, I am well versed in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and biology. I took classes at De Anza this summer which included a class that helped me become more knowledgeable in C++. So far, I have a semesterâ€™s worth of introductory experience with C++.<br><br>

         My job experience includes working in a local bookstore. I worked as a cashier for a local bookstore. On top of cashiering, I would assist customers to find books and other items they were looking for around the store. This job taught me a lot of people skills, how to deal with money, and how to work a cash register. I have also shadowed a dentist as well for a few weeks. Shadowing for a dentist where I would help clean dental tools and package the tools to be used during a dental procedure. This volunteering opportunity helped me gain stamina and work long hours standing up. I have also enrolled in a summer volunteer program where I would assist donors and organize the boxes that were going to be shipped for the needy in third world countries. I learned to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment and learned to work hard under pressure.Furthermore, my experience helping to raise my two younger siblings has given me valuable hands-on experience working with children and has allowed me to develop strong skills in mentorship and support. I am passionate about helping people and I believe that my enthusiasm and dedication will make me an asset to any team. I am confident that my leadership skills, team player attitude, critical thinking abilities, problem solving skills, strong communication skills, quick decision-making abilities, and time management skills make me an excellent fit for truly any position.
